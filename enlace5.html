			<h1>what is articial Inteligence</h1>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence is the scientific field of computing that focuses on creating programs and mechanisms that can display behaviors considered intelligent. In other words, AI is the concept according to which "machines think like human beings".

Typically, an AI system is capable of analyzing data in large quantities (big data), identifying patterns and trends, and therefore formulating predictions automatically, quickly and accurately. The important thing for us is that AI makes our everyday experiences smarter. How? By integrating predictive analytics (we'll talk about this later) and other AI techniques in applications we use on a daily basis.
